# GMS

This is a pascal source code for a game scroller 
engine, similar. Full source code  is available. 

If you plan in fixing the code - just cosmetic pull requests. I will not maintian this game besides the historical value. 

> **NOTE** 
>
> You will need Borland Pascal with Object (Turbo 
Pascal 7 is not enough, the game/engine must
run under protected mode, to utilize memory as needed) in order to compile it.
